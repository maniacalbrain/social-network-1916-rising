# A Social Network of the 1916 Rising.

On the 1st of June 2015 the National Archives released a tranche of documents compiled 100 years beforehand by the Dublin Metropolitan Police. These files related to ["The Movement of Extremists"](http://www.nationalarchives.ie/digital-resources/chief-secretarys-office-crime-branch-dublin-metropolitan-police-dmp-movement-of-extremists-29-may-1915-20-april-1916/) and include the daily meetings of people like Tom Clarke, P.H. Pearse and James Connolly. The files run from the 1st of June 1915 to the 20th of April 1916. Four days later a number of the people mentioned in this files stormed the GPO and other buildings throughout Dublin and proclaimed an independent Irish Republic.

Using these files I have built a social network which shows what kind of information the British authorities had in the run up to the Rising.
